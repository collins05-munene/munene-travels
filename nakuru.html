        <h2>About Lake Nakuru</h2>
        <p>
          Lake Nakuru is one of Kenya's most famous lakes, located in the heart
          of the Great Rift Valley. It is known for its stunning birdlife,
          including the famous flamingos that often cover the shores of the lake
          in a vibrant pink blanket.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lake is situated in the Lake Nakuru National Park, which is home
          to diverse wildlife such as giraffes, rhinos, buffaloes, and lions.
          The park also features beautiful landscapes and is a UNESCO biosphere
          reserve.
